# Test completed

I completed the hiring test in this repository.

Summary:

- Implementation: added upcoming movie listing, search for movies, movie details screens, and trailer playback.
- How to run: install dependencies and start the Expo dev server (commands below).
- Notes: see the `app/` and `api/` folders for the implementation; let me know if you want screenshots or a demo GIF.

Run locally:

```powershell
npm install
npx expo start
```
